## soundkey
[soundkey](https://www.github.com/jk2908/soundkey) is an on-going project to explore RSCs, server actions and other React 19 features. At the time of writing, some of the app's features and dependencies include:

+ Auth with [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/)
+ SQLite db utilising [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
+ [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
+ Lots of server actions to manage login/signout/verification and a WIP messaging system

All the components and hooks are homebaked too - labourious but fun and beneficial in many ways. The goal of this project is to build a CRM for music studios but much of the knowledge gain and code will seep it's way into other projects.

## fvb design
[FVB Design](https://www.fvb.design/) is a design practise run by friend and collaborator Florence van Bergen. Every few years we rebuild the site to show off her new showreel.
